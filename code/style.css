/*When you have the data that you need from the API, 
it's time to display it in a good way on the page. 
Think about how you want your page to look. 
Do you want to use an HTML table? 
Maybe the repos could be displayed in a grid format, with all the information inside? 
Maybe you want to make it look as closely to GitHub as possible?

- A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo - KLART
- Your username and profile picture - KLART
- Most recent update (push) for each repo - KLART + formatting 
- Name of your default branch for each repo - KLART
- URL to the actual GitHub repo - KLART
- Number of commits for each repo - HOW DO I FETCH THIS URL? 
- It should be responsive (mobile first)
- A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, 
of how many projects you've done so far, 
compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects ðŸ¥³) 
using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).*/
